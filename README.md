# Enhance and Optimize Hierarchical Modulations

Hierarchical modulation, also called layered modulation, is one of the techniques for multiplexing and modulating multiple data streams into one single symbol stream, where the base-layer symbols and enhancement-layer symbols are synchronously superimposed together before being transmitted.  When hierarchical modulation is employed, users with good reception and advanced receiver can demodulate more than one layer of data streams. For a user with conventional receiver or poor reception, it may be able to demodulate the data streams embedded in low layer(s), e.g, the base layer only. From an information-theoretical perspective, hierarchical modulation is one practical implementation of superposition
precoding, which can help achieve the maximum sum rate of Gaussian broadcast channel with employing interference cancellation by receivers. From a network operation perspective,
a network operator can seamlessly target users with different services or QoSâ€™s and this technique. 

However, traditional hierarchical modulation suffers from ILI so that the achievable rates by low-layer data streams, e.g. the base-layer data stream, can be dented by the interference from high-layer signal(s). For example, for the hierarchically modulated two-layer symbols comprising a 16QAM base layer and a QPSK enhancement layer, the base-layer throughput loss can be up to about 1.5bits/symbol with the total receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about 23dB. This means, due to ILI, there is about 1.5/4 = 37.5% loss of the base-layer achievable throughput with 23dB SNR. The demodulation error rate of both the base-layer and enhancement-layer symbols increases due to ILI.
